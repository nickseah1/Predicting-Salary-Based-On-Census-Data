The purpose of this project is to predict if an individual will earn more than $50,000 in Salary using Machine Learning.

The data is from the US Census Bureau


Identified factors that influence the salary of an individual.

Explored Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest Trees Algorithms. 

*Implemented a Random Forest Machine Learning Algorithm as it had the highest accuracy.
